Bamazon

This app is designed to be similar to Amazon, where it has a list of 10 items, with their price and quantity. The app prompts the user two messages.The first asks what they would like to buy, followed by the quantity. Once the customer places an order the quanity of that item will reduce by however many the user bought, so if we had 10 skateboards and the user buys 3, the database will say we have 7 available now. If the user wants to buy more items than what we have available, the database will prompt that we have 'Insuffient amount'. The app uses both node js and mysql, all changes made in node will also update in mysql database.
